Goal: to test if vanes have enough control authority
TLDR: qualitatively, it seems that vanes don't have enough control at high thrust. better test needed.
Details:
	This test was pretty bad for a bunch of reasons.
	Software: IMU was not regularly updated, leading to useless filter value results
	Hardware: Lack of bottom tether led to movement in non-roll axes being possible. astra was wobbly.
	Time: Not enough time to test lots of vane/thrust combos because we were testing on the last day bechtel would allow us to test.

Next steps:
	Conduct better test
	Consider changing test location. bechtel is annoying.
